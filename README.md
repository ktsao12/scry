I am the product of unfulfilled ambition;

The spawn of unrealistic dreams.

The bastard child of fantasy outcomes;

The pretender to the throne of Hope.

I am the person I most despised

Before I became that person myself.

A type, a sub-class, a nobody.

A statistic on an obscure chart.

I am who I am, no more or less

No better or worse than many others

Who look and sound - and probably

feel as I do - I suspect.

I am obscure, odd, unusual:

Irrelevant, discomfiting, but real.

I am the mirror that is called society

And I am here to stay no matter what.
